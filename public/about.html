<p>I like the colour lilac cause it is a very calming colour for me. My favourite flower is a red hibiscus and like it because it is the
  favourite flower of my favourite characters in my favourite anime. And if your wondering who my favourite character is than I will 
 Tell you. It is ace from one piece anime which by the way is my favourite anime. Ace like that without knowing it is the same flower
 His mother liked so it’s kinda touching to me. My favourite food is biriyani and my favourite drink is milkshake. I like cold foods more
 . For instance ice-cream or magnum. I also like spicy foods since I have been eating them since young it is common to eat food spicy 
 In our house.</p>

<p>What I don’t like is people bulling other people. And I highly dislike hero’s in an anime or not I don’t like them. I also don’t like bitter foods
  But it is very rarely. I most likely will eat any food that is good. I don’t like alcoholic drinks cause it is not allowed. There isn’t many things 
  I don’t like that comes to my mind. But there are many things I’m afraid of like snakes those terrifies me. I also don’t like some kind bugs.</p>
